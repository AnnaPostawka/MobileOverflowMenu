1. What external libraries did you use? What are they used for?

- styled-components - for an elegant CSS-in-JS solution
- hex-rgb - for converting colors from HEX to rgb
- i18next - for potential internationalization (translations)
- fontawesome - fonts matching the design

2. What are the difficulties you faced while working on this project? How did you manage to get around them? Feel free to link to StackOverflow posts- we're all constantly learning :)

I think the biggest challenge was writing an application in TypeScript as it's my first time using this language.
